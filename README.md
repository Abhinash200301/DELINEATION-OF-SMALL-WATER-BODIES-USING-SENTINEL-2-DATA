# DELINEATION-OF-SMALL-WATER-BODIES-USING-SENTINEL-2-DATA
This analysis delves into the detection of water bodies within the Odagaon block of Nayagarh district in Odisha, employing the advanced Deep learning model for segmentation called as the Nested-UNet or UNet++, in conjunction with the Machine Learning algorithm, XGBoost and spectral index, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The study rigorously assesses the effectiveness of these methodologies in accurately identifying water bodies and compares their performance based on the prediction on test data. The findings prominently demonstrate the superior accuracy of Deep learning over any other method, illustrating their remarkable efficiency in delineating water features within the region.
